# CardDrawGame-FreeBASIC
A console-based card draw game developed in FreeBASIC as part of a Year 12 Software Design and Development course in 2024.

This project was created to demonstrate key programming concepts, including:

- Random number generation
- Control structures (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and subroutines
- Console input/output and formatting
- Basic array use and simulation of card drawing mechanics

Players invest tokens and draw five random cards. Winnings are calculated based on matches, suits, and bonus conditions like flushes and sequences.
